# Mesa for 8 Gen 2 (Adreno 740)

The Frame image ships Valve's own Mesa (26.3.0-devel, a private commit). The
Frame is an Adreno 750, so that build doesn't carry the fixes the Adreno 740
needs, and on 8 Gen 2 devices nothing gets on screen. The 8 Gen 2 image
replaces the whole Mesa stack with this one instead, built from Mesa 26.2.3:

- `aarch64`: the system Mesa (Turnip for Vulkan, zink for GL, EGL, GLX, GBM)
- `x86_64` and `i386`: the Mesa that x86 games see under FEX
  (`/usr/share/guestos/fex-mesa`)

Same drivers as Valve's build, all built together, so zink and Turnip always
match. The 8 Gen 3 image keeps Valve's Mesa.
