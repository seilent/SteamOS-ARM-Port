## About

Valve's ARM build of SteamOS is made for a VR headset, so out of the box a lot
of it gets in the way on a handheld: services that keep crashing, the UI stuck
on the slow cores, the GPU not clocking up, standby that drains the battery. I
turned off what a handheld doesn't need and fixed the rest, the long version
is in [HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md).

What you get:

- Game Mode and Desktop Mode, with the controller showing up as a Steam Deck pad
- x86 PC games through FEX and ARM64 Proton, plus Epic, GOG and Amazon through Heroic
- Loadout, which installs emulators and apps picked for your SoC
- Sleep that lasts and quiet fan curves
- Updates through Steam, no reflashing
- Lossless Scaling frame gen, Decky and the performance overlay
- Android apps with the Play Store
- A dashboard on the bottom screen of the AYN Thor and AYANEO Pocket DS

## Devices

### Handhelds

| SoC | Devices | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Snapdragon 8 Elite | AYN Odin 3, KONKR Pocket FIT Elite | Stable |
| Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | KONKR Pocket FIT, AYANEO Pocket S2 / S2 Pro | Stable |
| Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 | AYN Odin 2 / Mini / Portal / Thor, AYANEO Pocket ACE / DMG / DS / EVO / S 1K / S 2K, Retroid Pocket 6 / Nova | Stable |
| Snapdragon 865 | AYANEO Pocket MICRO 2 | Testing |

There's one image per SoC, you pick your device in the ABL menu and it sets
itself up. I only own a Pocket FIT, so if you have one of the others please
[let me know how it runs](https://github.com/hashtagbasit/SteamOS-ARM-Port/issues).

### Phones & tablets

| Device | SoC | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Lenovo Legion Y700 Gen 3 (TB321FU) | Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Testing |
| Lenovo Legion Y700 Gen 4 (TB322FC) | Snapdragon 8 Elite | Testing |
| REDMAGIC 6 (NX669J) | Snapdragon 888 | Build it yourself ([guide](docs/redmagic6.md)) |

The Lenovo tablets boot from a USB drive and install to internal storage,
nobody has run them on a real tablet yet. If you have one and want to help,
ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EP53nZYvg) and see the
[Lenovo page](https://steamos-arm-port.github.io/devices/lenovo/).
