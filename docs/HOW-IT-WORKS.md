# How SteamOS ARM runs on the KONKR Pocket FIT

Valve's SteamOS ARM (unofficial port) on the **KONKR Pocket FIT (Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 = SM8650, Adreno 750)**, with
some groundwork from [MaSi's SM8550 project](https://github.com/MaSieS4Fun/SteamOS-ARM-SM8550), plus
Pocket FIT-specific controls and a set of native performance fixes. The
AYANEO Pocket S2 shares the ROCKNIX dtsi and gets a DTB too (untested).

## Why this works at all

- The SteamOS ARM userspace this project repackages is Valve's
  **Steam Frame** image, and the Steam Frame *is* SM8650 / Adreno 750. Valve's
  own Turnip, zink and GPU firmware target this exact GPU, so the sm8650 build
  keeps Valve's Mesa unless `MESA_STACK` is set. The v1.3.0 sm8650 release
  image ships our Mesa 26.2.3 with GL through zink, with Valve's Mesa in
  `/opt/stock-steamos`.
- Everything device-specific comes from ROCKNIX, which already boots Linux on
  this handheld: kernel patches, DTS, kernel config, AYANEO-signed
  ADSP/CDSP/GPU-zap firmware, audio topology + UCM, ChipOne touch driver.

## What's in this build

### Controls (Steam sees a real Steam Deck controller)

| Pocket FIT | Steam | Source |
|------------|-------|--------|
| KONKR / home (`BTN_MODE`) | Steam button | USB pad |
| extra front button (`BTN5`) | Quick Access (…) | USB pad |
| LC1 / RC1 back buttons (`BTN_Z` / `BTN_C`) | L4 / R4 | USB pad |
| KONKR (MCU) | Quick Access | MCU link* |
| LC / RC next to the shoulders | L5 / R5 | MCU link* |
| front-top-right (Performance) | F14 → cycle **Silent / Balanced / Turbo** | MCU link* |
| front-bottom-right | F13 → cycle stick RGB preset | MCU link* |
| Hall triggers (either trigger mode), sticks, D-pad, ABXY, Start/Select | as on a Deck | USB pad |

\*The **MCU link** is the ROCKNIX `konkr_sysbtn` UART driver (written for the
Pocket FIT Elite), bound to the FIT's controller UART (`uart13 @894000`). It
works on the regular FIT and is on by default. `konkrctl mcu disable` turns it
off; `konkrctl monitor` shows which button sends what. Button actions live in
`/etc/konkrd.conf`.

The pad boots as a fake Xbox 360 pad (`045e:028e`), and in that mode the back
buttons send nothing. konkrd switches it to the AYANEO default mode
(`4001:0428`) at startup via the `gamepad_mode` attribute that kernel patch
0004 adds to `konkr_sysbtn` (same MCU frames ArmadaOS uses). To keep the Xbox
mode, set `mode = xbox` under `[controller]` in `/etc/konkrd.conf`.

### Performance: why Linux was slower than GameNative on Android, and the fixes

GameNative's current profiles run Wine as ARM64EC with FEX for x86 code, the
same model as the ARM Proton builds here. The gap was the **platform**:

| Bottleneck (verified in source/config) | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Fan pinned at 70/255 (~27%) forever.** ROCKNIX `0500-set-boot-fanspeed` sets it once, and the DT fan trips have no `cooling-maps`. The SoC heat-soaks and Qualcomm LMh throttles CPU and GPU under sustained load. Android's thermal HAL ramps the fan to 100%. | `konkrd` runs a real temperature curve per profile (hysteresis, failsafe 180/255 if it ever stops). |
| **GPU capped at 834 MHz.** Mainline's SM8650 OPP table stops there; the 8 Gen 3 runs its A750 at **903 MHz** on Android. | `opp-903000000` at the fused `TURBO_L1` corner is added to the Pocket FIT DTB. |
| **`performance` governor on all 8 cores** (ROCKNIX default), including the Cortex-A520 little cores that games barely use. Pure heat, feeding the throttling. | `schedutil` by default; Turbo pins only the big clusters to `performance`. |
| **No game-aware scheduling** (`CONFIG_UCLAMP_TASK` was off). Android's game mode keeps game threads on big cores. | uclamp enabled. `konkrd` keeps threads of Steam-launched games off the A520s and gives them a `uclamp.min` boost (Balanced 25%, Turbo 50%). |
| GPU devfreq samples every 50 ms, so clocks lag frame load. | 16 ms polling. |
| Windows sync primitives via esync/fsync. | `CONFIG_NTSYNC` + `/dev/ntsync` autoloaded and accessible (Proton ntsync). |
| Games stream from microSD (Android: UFS 4.0). | 2 MB read-ahead + mq-deadline on the card. The card is still the ceiling: use a fast A2 card. |

Per-game FEX presets (Steam → Properties → Launch Options):

```
konkr-game fast %command%      # x87 reduced precision + ntsync — safe for most
konkr-game fastest %command%   # also TSO off — biggest CPU win, may crash MT games
konkr-game compat %command%    # strict TSO / split locks for crashing games
```

### Display

- **60 / 90 / 120 / 144 Hz**: kernel patch `0003` makes the panel list all four
  at one pixel clock (vertical front porch only, like the Deck OLED), and a
  gamescope patch builds the refresh table from that list because the DSI panel
  has no EDID. Steam then offers frame limits for every rate and switches the
  panel to match. Game Mode starts at 144 Hz.
- **Performance Overlay works.** On SM8550 it was disabled: mangoapp is GL,
  GL on the Frame is zink-on-Turnip, and swapping only `libvulkan_freedreno.so`
  mismatched the pair, so mangoapp crashed. With Valve's Mesa in `/usr/lib`,
  mangoapp is pinned to a saved copy of the Frame's Turnip
  (`/usr/lib/steamos-sm8650/bin/mangoapp`), so the overlay keeps working even
  if you install another Turnip with MESA-Easy-Manager. With our Mesa it runs
  on the system Turnip, no pin. `gamescope-onready` also now passes Steam the
  full Valve environment list (`STEAM_USE_MANGOAPP`, `MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE`,
  `STEAM_DISPLAY_REFRESH_LIMITS`, …), which the SM8550 session dropped.

### Lighting

- Power LED (PM8550 LPG, RGB): profile colour flash on change (blue/green/red),
  then amber while charging, green when full, red pulse below 15%.
- Stick RGB rings (MCU link): static / breath / rainbow / off from KONKR
  Control, `konkrctl rgb`, or the front-bottom-right button.

### Quick Access panel: KONKR Control (Decky)

Profile, live temperature, fan and GPU clock, stick lighting, MCU link toggle,
It replaces the SM8550-Power and SM8550-LED plugins,
which would fight `konkrd` over the fan and drive AYN-only LEDs.

## Compared with the SM8550 setup, in short

| Area | SM8550 (MaSi) | Pocket FIT (this project) |
|------|---------------|--------------------|
| Kernel | 7.0.14 + Armbian sm8550 | **7.1.2** (ROCKNIX 20260801 SM8650 recipe) + Pocket FIT patches (`external-and-mods/kernel-sm8650/`) |
| DTB selection | 14-slot index chain | ROCKNIX ABL ≥ 1.1.8 matches the DTB `model` string |
| Root | initramfs + `root=UUID=` | tiny busybox initramfs (writes `bootlog.txt` to the FAT partition), `root=PARTUUID=` patched at image pack |
| GPU userspace | patched A740 Turnip | Valve's Turnip/zink (A750), or our Mesa 26.2.3 with `MESA_STACK` (v1.3.0 release image) |
| Controller | `rsinput` serial MCU | USB XInput pad → InputPlumber `deck-uhid` (+ optional MCU link) |
| Audio | `AYN-Odin2` | `SM8650-APS2`: WSA884x speakers + WCD939x, ROCKNIX UCM |
| UFS installer | SM8550 layouts | rewritten for the Pocket FIT: keeps Android, backs up the partition table |

## Build (Mac → Colima, native arm64)

```bash
colima start --cpu 8 --memory 10 --mount "$WORKSPACE:w"
colima ssh -- sudo mount -o loop,noatime "$WORKSPACE/work.ext4" /work
```

`$WORKSPACE` is the folder with this repo and a `work.ext4` image. `/work` is that ext4 image *file*. The rootfs, ownership and
symlinks need a Linux filesystem, which exFAT is not. Build from a copy of
this tree inside `/work` (normalised to root-owned 0644/0755):

```bash
bash external-and-mods/kernel-sm8650/build.sh                      # kernel
sudo bash scripts/build-gamescope-in-rootfs.sh /work/rootfs        # gamescope
sudo STEAMOS_WORK=/work BOX64_SRC=/work/box64 \
     STEAM_ARM_SEED=/work/steam-seed-home/.local/share/Steam \
     bash make-steamos-sm8650.sh                                    # image
```

Output: `/work/steamos-sm8650.img`.

## Install on the Pocket FIT

1. **ROCKNIX ABL** (`abl_signed-SM8650.elf`, [v1.1.8](https://github.com/ROCKNIX/abl/releases))
   flashed to `abl_a` and `abl_b`. It replaces the bootloader; Android still
   boots from its menu. Verify the SHA256.
2. Flash `steamos-sm8650.img` to a microSD (balenaEtcher / `dd`).
3. Power on holding **Volume Down** → **Set device model** →
   **KONKR Pocket FIT** → Boot mode **Linux** → START.
4. The first boot takes 2–3 minutes.

## Other stuff fixed on the Pocket FIT

- Standby: the Frame's ADB, USB gadget, power monitor and FPGA services are
  masked since they just crash-loop and keep the SoC awake. Sleep runs
  `konkr-standby`, which turns the panel off, freezes the session, takes the
  big cores offline and unloads wifi.
- Some ARM64 Proton games hung on their splash screen because wined3d's GL
  path goes through zink. `WINE_D3D_CONFIG=renderer=vulkan` fixes it.
- `konkr-focusfix` gives the game focus back after Quick Access closes,
  otherwise some games ignore the controller until you tap the screen.
- decky-lsfg-vk 0.14.4 is bundled. It installs lsfg-vk 2.0 with x86 layers
  only, so the image adds an unmodified aarch64 build of lsfg-vk 2.0 as its own
  layer (`VK_LAYER_LSFGVK_frame_generation_arm64`) for ARM64 games. The plugin's
  install step and config check work on ARM because its x86 CLI runs through Box64.
- Box64 is one armv8.2 build (box64's `SD865` target) for every chip, pinned
  to the box64 commit in `BOX64_REF` (`scripts/build-box64-in-rootfs.sh`).
- SSH is on by default (password login for `steamos`, root off).
- Desktop mode: the Steam keyboard works in Wayland apps, Discover gets the
  Flathub catalog, and KWin/plasmashell get the big-core boost too.
- Steam gets the refresh rate and overlay settings from a file now, the old
  import raced Steam's startup and lost.

## Not tested yet

- 903 MHz stability on every chip. If you see GPU hangs, remove the
  `&gpu_opp_table` block from `external-and-mods/kernel-sm8650/dts/sm8650-konkr-pf.append`
  and rebuild, or use the Silent profile.
- AYANEO Pocket S2: has a DTB, never booted.
- AYANEO Pocket MICRO 2: runs ArmadaOS's Pocket MICRO 2 kernel (Linux 7.2.6, arm64
  defconfig, ArmadaOS config and patch series, its device tree) from the
  `steamos-port-pm2` branch of seilent/armada: sleep fixes, USB-C DP alt mode,
  DP audio and the SLPI sensor DSP. GPU capped at the 587 MHz stock max. Mesa
  26.2.3 with GL through zink, from its v1.3.0 base image.
- AYANEO Pocket MICRO 2 audio: the shared `sm8550-audio-pipewire` watcher skips
  the PM2. The default sink goes by `steamos-arm.sink-rank`:
  Bluetooth 5, USB 4, headphones 3, DisplayPort 2, speaker 1. A sink the user
  picked wins while it is present. On DP hotplug `pm2-dp-audio-reprobe` adds a DisplayPort device
  to the HiFi UCM once the DP PCM plays and drops it on unplug.
  `steamos-arm-pm2-audio-state` clears the speaker default and profile the
  watcher stored, once per user.
- AYANEO Pocket MICRO 2 sensors: `steamos-arm-slpi-sensors` copies the SLPI
  firmware, the `sdsp` libraries and the sensor registry from the Android
  `modem`, `dsp` and `persist` partitions to `/var/lib/steamos-arm/` and starts
  the SLPI. `steamos-arm-hexagonrpcd` serves `/dev/fastrpc-sdsp`, stopped across
  suspend. InputPlumber's `ssc` source (`0003`, PM2 binary only) reads the
  accelerometer and gyro at 400 Hz as the Deck controller's IMU.
- Which USB `phys_path` the internal pad uses (an external Xbox 360 pad with
  the same IDs gets merged into the same virtual Deck controller).
